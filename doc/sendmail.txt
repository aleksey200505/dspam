SENDMAIL INTEGRATION

Please follow the instructions in the README for building DSPAM. Once DSPAM
has been built, the following instructions may be used to integrate it with
sendmail.
 
DSPAM is best integrated with sendmail by masquerading as the local delivery
agent. This can be done by adding two lines to your config.mc file and
rebuilding your configuration:

define(`LOCAL_MAILER_PATH', `/usr/local/bin/dspam')
define(`LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS', `dspam "--deliver=innocent" --user $u -d %u') 

Make sure these definitions are placed before the MAILER(local) definition.

Alternatively, you may define additional procmail arguments if you are using
procmail. For example:

define(`LOCAL_MAILER_PATH', `/usr/local/bin/dspam')
define(`LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS', 
      `dspam -t -Y -a $h "--deliver=innocent" --user $u -d %u')

If you don't feel like rebuilding your .cf files, you can alternatively
just replace your local mailer in the Mlocal block of sendmail.cf and
submit.cf. Be sure to update the path (P=) as well as arguments (A=).

NOTE: If you are using sendmail restricted shell (smrsh), you will
      need to either disable it, or add /usr/local/bin/dspam to the allow list. 
      Some administrators have experienced problems using smrsh with DSPAM.
