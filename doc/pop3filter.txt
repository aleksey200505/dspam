POP3FILTER INTEGRATION

Please follow the instructions in the README for building DSPAM. Once DSPAM
has been built, the following instructions may be used to integrate it with
pop3filter.

pop3filter is an open-source POP3 proxy tool which can be used to provide
spam filtering without the need for inbound mail server integration.  The
software is configured to run as a "proxy"; that is, users are directed to
check their email using the proxy's ip address (or are transparently
redirected there) at which point the proxy will open up a connection to
the mail server and filter mail as it is being downloaded by the user.

pop3filter can be downloaded from http://pop3filter.sourceforge.net/.

The easiest way to set up pop3filter is to have it call DSPAM using the
--stdout command, at which point DSPAM will check the message and return
it with X-DSPAM headers identifying the message as spam or innocent.  To
do this, follow these steps:

1. Compile and install pop3filter
2. Compile and install DSPAM on the same machine

   You may optionally wish to the spamSubject and spamAction=tag preferences
   so that a tag will be prepended to the subject header of messages
   suspected to be spam.

3. Configure pop3filter to run as follows:

 pop3filter --fork [mail server IP] 110 110 "/usr/local/bin/dspam --user \
  \$POP3_USERNAME --stdout --deliver=innocent,spam "

a full blown example would look like:

 pop3filter --fork 10.0.0.1 110 110 "/usr/local/bin/dspam --user \
  \$POP3_USERNAME --stdout --deliver=innocent,spam"

The POP3_USERNAME variable will be automatically replaced with the username
provided by the client at connect time.

Mail will then be checked by DSPAM and an X-DSPAM-Result field will be
appended to the message headers identifying the classification of the
message.
