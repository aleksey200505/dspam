COURIER INTEGRATION

Please follow the instructions in the README for building DSPAM. Once DSPAM
has been built, the following instructions may be used to integrate it with
courier.

STEP 1: CONFIGURING DSPAM AS DELIVERY AGENT

To configure Courier to use DSPAM as its delivery agent, you'll want to
change the DEFAULTDELIVERY parameter. In the file /etc/courier/courierd,
find the line for DEFAULTDELIVERY and change it to:

DEFAULTDELIVERY="| /usr/local/bin/dspam --deliver=innocent --user $USER"

STEP 2: CONFIGURING MAILDROP AS DSPAM'S DELIVERY AGENT

Maildrop is Courier's native equivalent of procmail.  To configure DSPAM to 
use it, set the following in dspam.conf:

TrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/bin/maildrop -d %u"

...or configure with --with-delivery-agent="/usr/bin/maildrop -d %u"

You'll also need to configure your untrusted delivery agent as Courier drops
to the uid of the destination user and changes to that users homedir before
calling the LDA.  Accomplish this by using the same argument for
UntrustedDeliveryAgent in dspam.conf.

UntrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/bin/maildrop -d %u"

STEP 3: CONFIGURE DSPAM ALIASES

The aliases for missed spam/false positives should be added to the file
/etc/courier/aliases/system.  After adding new aliases, run 'makealiases'
and restart Courier. See the README for intructions on creating aliases.
