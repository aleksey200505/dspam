MAC OSX NOTES

DSPAM builds well on OSX, with a few minor caveats, as described below.

Autogen
If you're building from CVS, you'll need a few tools in order to perform an
autogen. The latest versions of autoconf, automake, and libtool will need to
be installed first. This can be done quite easily using an OSX package tool.
Visit http://www.darwinports.com or http://fink.sf.net for more information.
Once you've installed these latest tools, you'll need to run autogen-glibtool.sh
to generate a new configure script . Be sure that the path to these new binaries
comes first in your path. This is usually /opt/local/bin (darwinports) or
/sw/local/bin (fink).

Library Patches
OSX complains about libraries containing "common symbols". In order to build
DSPAM with certain backends, it will be necessary to reassemble the library.
The example below shows how to do this with the MySQL client library. If you're
using a different backend, you may need to tailor this to your particular
problem.

% cd /usr/local/mysql/lib
% mv libmysqlclient.a libmysqlclient.a.original
% mkdir /tmp/mysql
% cd /tmp/mysql
% ar x /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.a.original
% ld -r -d my_error.o
% mv a.out my_error.o
% libtool -o /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.a *.o

... ignore any warnings about "no symbols"

Once you've configured and compiled DSPAM on OSX, see one of the other README
files for more information about integrating it with your favorite MTA.
