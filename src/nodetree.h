/* Nodetree: An ordered dynamic data collection structure
 *
 *  Nodetree is designed to provide an ordered collective dynamic data
 *  structure for arrays of unknown size, where it is impractical to
 *  overallocate space.  Nodetree allows the user to allocate memory for
 *  new items as needed, and provides simple management and iteration
 *  functionality.  It is a linked list on steroids.
 *
 *  Nodetree types:
 *
 *  NT_CHAR	Character Nodetree
 *		Treats the passed pointer as a const char * and creates
 * 		new storage space for each string
 *
 *  NT_PTR	Pointer Nodetree
 *		Does not perform string conversion, instead just stores
 *		the pointer's location in the nodetree.  Prior to adding
 *              an item, the user should malloc storage for the new
 *              structure and pass the pointer to the nodetree functions.
 *
 *  NT_INDEX	Pointer Index
 *              Same as Pointer Nodetree, only does not free() the ptr
 *              objects upon deletion
