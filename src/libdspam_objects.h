/*
 *  DSPAM_CTX - The DSPAM Classification Context
 *
 *  A classification context is attached directly to a filter instance 
 *  and supplies the entire context for the filter instance to operate
 *  under.  This  includes  the  user  and group,  operational  flags, 
 *  training  mode, and  the message  being  operated  on. The  filter
 *  instance also  sets specific output variables  within the  context
 *  such  as the  result of a  classification,  confidence  level, and
 *  etcetera.
 *
 *  username, group (input)
 *    The current username and group that is being operated on. 
 *
 *  totals (output)
 *    The set of statistics loaded when dspam_init() is called.
 *
 *  signature (input, output)
 *    The signature represents a DSPAM signature, and can be  supplied
 *    as  an input  variable for  retraining  (e.g. in the  event of a 
 *    misclassification)  or  used as  an output  variable  to store a 
 *    signature  generated   by  the  filter  instance  during  normal 
 *    classification.
 *
 *  message (input)
 *    The  message being operated on, post-actualization. This can  be 
 *    left NULL, and libdspam will automatically actualize the message
 *
 *  probability (output)
 *    The probability of the resulting operation.  This is generally a
 *    floating  point number  between 0 and  1, 1  being  the  highest 
 *    probability of high order classification.
 *
 *  result (output)
 *    The  final result of the requested operation.  This is generally 
 *    either DSR_ISSPAM, DSR_ISINNOCENT, or DSR_WHITELISTED.
 *
 *  confidence (output)
 *    The  confidence  that the  filter has  in  its  returned  result. 
 *    NOTE: Confidence is not always supported, and may be zero.
 *
 *  operating_mode (input)
 *    Sets the operating mode of the filter instance.  This can be one
 *    of the following:
 *
 *	DSM_PROCESS	Classify and learn the  supplied message using 
 *			whatever training mode is specified 
 *
 *	DSM_CLASSIFY	Classify the  supplied  message  only; do  not 
 *                      learn or update any counters.
 *
 *	DSM_TOOLS	Identifies that  the calling function is  from
 *			a utility, and no operation will be requested.
 *
 *  training_mode (input)
 *    The training mode sets the type of training the filter  instance 
 *    should apply to the process. This can be one of:
 *
 *	DST_TEFT		Train-on-Everything
 *				Trains every single message  processed
 *
 *	DST_TOE			Train-on-Error
 *				Trains only on a misclassification  or
 *                              corpus-fed message.
 *
 *	DST_TUM			Train-until-Mature
 *				Trains individual tokens based on  the
 *				maturity of the user's dictionary
 *
 *      DST_NOTRAIN		No Training
 *                              Process the message but do not perform 
 *                              any training.
 *  training_buffer (input)
 *    Sets the amount  of training-loop buffering.  This  number is  a 
 *    range from 0-10  and changes  the amount of  token sedation used 
 *    during the training loop.  The higher the number, the more token 
 *    statistics are watered down  during initial  training to prevent 
 *    false  positives.  Setting  this  value to  zero results  in  no 
 *    sedation being performed.
 *
 *  flags (input)
 *    Applies different fine-tuning behavior to the context:
 *
 *	DSF_NOISE		Apply Bayesian Noise Reduction logic
 *	DSF_SIGNATURE		Signature is provided/requested
 *      DSF_WHITELIST		Use automatic whitelisting logic
 *      DSF_MERGED		Merge user/group data in memory
 *      DSF_UNLEARN		Unlearn the message
 *      DSF_BIAS		Assign processor bias to unknown tokens
 *
 *  tokenizer (input)
 *    Specifies which tokenizer to use
 *
 *      DSZ_WORD		Use WORD (uniGram) tokenizer
 *      DSZ_CHAIN               Use CHAIN (biGram) tokenizer
 *      DSZ_SBPH                Use SBPH (Sparse BP Hashing) tokenizer
 *      DSZ_OSB                 Use OSB (Orthogonal Sparse biGram)
 *
 *  algorithms (input)
 *    Optional API to override the default algorithms. This value is set
 *    with the default compiled values whenever dspam_create() is called.
 *
 *	DSA_GRAHAM		Graham-Bayesian
 *	DSA_BURTON		Burton-Bayesian    
 *	DSA_ROBINSON		Robinson's Geometric Mean Test
 *	DSA_CHI_SQUARE		Fisher-Robinson's Chi-Square
 *      DSA_NAIVE		Naive-Bayesian
 * 
 *    P-Value Computations:
 *
 *      DSP_ROBINSON		Robinson's Technique
 *      DSP_GRAHAM		Graham's Technique
 *      DSP_MARKOV		Markov Weighted Technique
 *
 *  locked (output)
 *    Identifies that the user's storage is presently locked
