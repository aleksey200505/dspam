.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B dspam_merge
merges several users' metadata into a single user's dictionary. This tool
is designed to create global users and seeded data. The hit sounds for each
token and per-user totals are added together to produce a single composite
dataset. After creating a composite user,

should be run with the -p option to clean up extraneous data.
