RELEASE 3.9.0

Why should you upgrade to DSPAM 3.9.0?
======================================

The question of whatever to upgrade and when are always hard ones. You got your
DSPAM up and running since ages and it's doing a fine job and now there is this
brand new DSPAM 3.9.0 and you don't know if you should upgrade and when and why?
We as the DSPAM community can not take that decision for you and you should read
careful the README and UPGRADING document and look if an upgrade is something
for you or not. But allow us to help you making that decision by pointing out
some benefits of DSPAM 3.9.0 compared to older releases of DSPAM.

Enhanced stability
------------------
We took the time to hunt down and fix most cases of stability issues found in
the older releases of DSPAM. The new DSPAM 3.9.0 has more robust
 - character decoding
 - HTML mail processing
 - memory handling
 - storage engines
 - SBPH/OSB tokenizing
 - and much, much more

Memory handling
---------------
We reduced the memory footprint on many parts in DSPAM. No more restarting of
DSPAM after days of running because of memory leaks. We fixed most of them.
Allocated memory is freed after it's not used any more. But that's not all.
Should you for example use MySQL and you have set 'max_allowed_packet' to a low
value, then DSPAM will honor your decision and use no more then you have told it
to use. Not only MySQL storage driver will honor your database settings but the
other SQL-based storage engines in DSPAM will do the same.

HTML mail handling
------------------
We enhanced the way DSPAM processes your HTML mail. The older HTML processing
engine in DSPAM was replaced with a much better and under certain conditions
faster processing engine. If you receive a lot of mails in HTML then DSPAM 3.9.0
is the best DSPAM you can get today for correctly processing your HTML mail. If
most of your mails are non English then you will love DSPAM 3.9.0. We now
correctly convert most of the special encoded characters found in typical non
English HTML mails to their proper decoded characters. As a side effect you will
get higher accuracy from DSPAM 3.9.0 compared to older releases.

Character decoding
------------------
Not only have we enhanced the character decoding in DSPAM 3.9.0, but we've also
took the decoding engine to the next level and improved processing speed
significantly.

Storage engines
---------------
Ever executed something like 'dspam_admin change preference myuser
"trainingMode" "toe"' while using the PostgreSQL driver and then realized that
DSPAM wrote a bunch of non-readable characters in your preference table if the
user "myuser" did not exist before in that table? Done the same with the MySQL
storage driver and realized that there it worked? Well... we fixed those
problems. MySQL? PostgreSQL? SQLite? It's not important which one you use. We
adjusted the SQL-based storage driver to be equal in their core.

Scalability
-----------
You always wanted to handle more users on your DSPAM installation but you where
limited by the amount of user ID's DSPAM could handle? Not any more! DSPAM 3.9.0
can now handle up to 2,147,483,647 users before it reaches a technical limit on
certain storage engines. But not only has the number of possible users
increased, but also the statistical counters where changed to allow you to store
not less then the double amount compared to older DSPAM releases.

Speed improvement
-----------------
You have read all the above points and are still not convinced in upgrading?
Okay. How about the vast speed improvement we have introduced in DSPAM 3.9.0.
That should convince you. We speed up DSPAM every where we could without
scarifying stability. We speed up character decoding, HTML mail processing,
storage engines, SBPH/OSB tokenizing, buffer management, SQL queries, the
purging scripts and much much more.

Documentation
-------------
We listen carefully to the needs of our user base and have updated the
documentation to have more examples and being more accurate then ever. And we
have documented even more options available in DSPAM which where never published
before.

Additional/enhanced functionality
---------------------------------
Wait! That's not all! We even added new functionality to DSPAM. A brand new
module is introduced in DSPAM 3.9.0 to help you do more versatile and flexible
lookups against LDAP and/or use external programs to do lookups. Have we
mentioned the enhancements and new functions in the training script? Yes! We
added finally MBOX training. Let's not forget RBLLookups! We enhanced that as
well. And we enhanced SBPH/OSB tokenizing. And we pushed more configuration
options into the preference extension. And we enhanced the output of statistical
data. And, and, and... still not convinced?

Final notes
-----------
Should you upgrade? Why not? DSPAM is free software and there is no price
attached to a new release. You can upgrade to new releases when ever you are
ready to do so. We took extra care to not change DSPAM 3.9.0 to render your old
trained data and tokens to be useless. So you can upgrade without loosing your
old data (please read the UPGRADING document found in the root directory of the
DSPAM source). We (the core team behind DSPAM) and the DSPAM community will off
course be there to help and assist you in your upgrade to 3.9.0. BUT should you
decide to stay on a older version, then this is fine with us. It's your
decision. For us it does not change anything. You can still ask your questions
on the DSPAM user list [1] and/or report your problems in our issue tracking
system [2]. No matter what release of DSPAM you use.
As a matter of course we think that DSPAM 3.9.0 is worth to be installed. It's
the best DSPAM you can get today. We are very proud of what we as a community
have reached so far in the short time since we took over DSPAM. And we want to
share that positive experience with you. Go and grab yourself a copy of the
source or binary and give DSPAM 3.9.0 a try. You will not be disappointed.
